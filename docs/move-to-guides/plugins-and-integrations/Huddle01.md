# Token Gated Meetings on Huddle01

## About Huddle01
Huddle01 is a web3 video-conferencing platform that imbibes all the qualities of the Web3 ecosystem.
Along with NFTs as PFPs, we also support token-gated meetings. Let’s see how to schedule a token-gated meeting with Huddle01 and Unlock protocol! 

## Unlock: Create a Lock

In the Unlock Creator Dashboard, create a Lock. After naming the Lock, and filling in the duration, quantity, and price fields, confirm the new lock

Once confirmed, you should find the address for the lock underneath the title.
The address will start with “0x…” and be a string of letters and numbers. Keep this address copied,as it will be used for the cal.com integration
